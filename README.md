This project will make you sort data on a stack, with a limited set of instructions, using
the lowest possible number of actions. To succeed youâ€™ll have to manipulate various
types of algorithms and choose the most appropriate solution (out of many) for an
optimized data sorting.

The ***Push swap*** project is a very simple and a highly straightforward algorithm project:
data must be sorted.

You have at your disposal a set of integer values, 2 stacks, and a set of instructions
to manipulate both stacks.

Your goal? Write a program in C called push_swap which calculates and displays
on the standard output the smallest program, made of Push swap language instructions,
that sorts the integers received as arguments.
